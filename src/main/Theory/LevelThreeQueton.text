What is the purpose of the public keyword in Java?
    Answer: public keyword in java use as an access modifier. Purpose of using public keyword is that it specify
    whether a class, method or field can accessed and used from other parts of the program, including from different
    package.
What is the purpose of the private keyword in Java?
    Answer: private keyword is used in java to restrict visibility and accessibility of a class member such as method,
    field and inner class with in a class. Its primary purpose is to encapsulate the internal state and behavior of a
    class in its own class, providing control over who can access and modify these members.
What is the purpose of the protected keyword in Java?
    Answer: protected keyword is used to control visibility and accessibility of a class member(fields, methods, class)
    in classes, subclasses and in under same packages. Its primary purpose is to strike a balance between encapsulation
     and inheritance by allowing controlled access to members to support subclassing and code reusability.
What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java?
    Answer: static keyword is used to create members(classes, methods and fields) which belong to the class itself.
    It is used in creating shared data, utilities, constant and so on.
What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java?
    Answer: final keyword is used when a member(methods, fields) can't be changed. It is used to enforced immutability
    it is prevent method overriding, define constant. It is used for code maintainability, reliability, quality by
    making some methods and fields unchangeable and undependable.
What is the purpose of the abstract keyword in Java?
    Answer: abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes and methods, which are essential for achieving
    polymorphism, code reusability, and defining a common contract that subclasses must adhere to. Abstract classes
    provide a way to create a hierarchical structure of related classes while enforcing specific behavior
    in subclasses.
What is the purpose of the interface keyword in Java?
    Answer: interface keyword is used in java to declare interfaces, which defines a contract, allow a way to achieve
    multiple inheritance and facilitate polymorphism.  When a class implements an interface, it is forced to provide
    concrete implementations for all the methods declared in that interface. This ensures that specific behaviors
    are defined in implementing classes.
What is the purpose of the new keyword in Java?
    Answer: Purpose of new keyword is creating instance of a class.
What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?
    Answer: Class is a blueprint for creating an object, and An object is instance of a class which defines states,
    behaviour or action of a class. class is created in compile-time and objects are created on runtime.
What is the purpose of the main() method in Java?
    Answer: main() method is execution engine of a java program.
What is the difference between a float and a double in Java?
    Answer: float and double both are used to represent floating number. The main differences between two data type
    is in size and precession. double hold 64 bit and float hold 32 bits. because double has more bits to represent
    factional parts of a number, it has more precession than a float.

What is the difference between an int and a long in Java?
    Answer: These two data type are different in size and range. int has 32 bits, and long has 64 bits.
What is the purpose of the System.out.println() method in Java?
    Answer: purpose of using this method is to print a text in the output console.
What is the purpose of the Scanner class in Java?
    Answer: Purpose of using Scanner class in java is to read data primarily from the keyboard and a file. Its main
    purpose is to facilitate the reading and parsing of different types of data, such as numbers, text, and other
    tokens, from an input stream.
What is the purpose of the Math class in Java?
    Answer: Math Class is used in java to do wide range of mathematical functions in java.
What is the purpose of the String class in Java?
    Answer: The String class in Java is used to represent and manipulate sequences of characters. It provides a wide
    range of methods to perform operations on strings, such as concatenation, comparison, searching, and extraction.
    Strings are widely used in Java for text processing and are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed
    after creation, ensuring data integrity and security.
What is the purpose of the StringBuilder class in Java?
    Answer: The StringBuilder class in Java is used for efficiently constructing and manipulating mutable sequences
    of characters, which are often referred to as "string buffers." Unlike the String class, which is immutable,
    StringBuilder allows you to modify the contents of a string without creating new objects, making it more
    efficient for tasks that involve frequent string concatenation or modification. It provides methods for
    appending, inserting, deleting, and updating characters within the string buffer. This class is particularly
    useful for building dynamic strings in situations where performance is a concern.
What is the purpose of the equals() method in Java?
    Answer: equals() is used in java to compare two instance of a class to see if content or value both method
    are same.
What is the purpose of the compareTo() method in Java?
    Answer:  The compareTo() method in Java is used for comparing two objects of a class that implements the
    Comparable interface. Its primary purpose is to establish a natural ordering or sorting of objects based on their
    attributes.
What is the purpose of the toString() method in Java?
    Answer: toString() method is used to provide a text so that human can read. For examole, It converts an object
    into a string format so that developer easily could understand.
