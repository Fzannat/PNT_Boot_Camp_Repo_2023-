What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?
    Answer: Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods. An interface can only have abstract method,
    but after java 8, an interface can have default and static method with implementation. Abstract class can have
    instance variable but interface can't have. multiple inheritance is not allowed in abstract class but you can
    implement multiple interfaces. Abstract class is used when you want to provide a common base for multiple classes
    that share some common behavior. Interface work as a contract that multiple class can be adhere to, irrespective
    to their class hierarchy.
What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java?
    Answer: static keyword is used to create members(classes, methods and fields) which belong to the class itself.
    It is used in creating shared data, utilities, constant and so on.
What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java?
    Answer: final keyword is used when a member(methods, fields) can't be changed. It is used to enforced immutability
    it is prevent method overriding, define constant. It is used for code maintainability, reliability, quality by
    making some methods and fields unchangeable and undependable.
What is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception in Java?
    Answer: Checked exception are checked in compile-time but unchecked exception are not checked in compile-time.
    checked exception are subclasses of Exception class, unchecked exception are subclass of RuntimeException.
    Any method that might throw a checked exception must declare it using the throws keyword in its method signature.
    For unchecked exception, you don't need to throw any throws declaration in method signature. Example of checked
    exceptions are IOException, ClassNotFoundException, and SQLException. example of unchecked exception are
    NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException.Checked exceptions are used for
    situations that a well-behaved program should anticipate and handle, such as file I/O errors or database connection
    issues. Unchecked exceptions are typically used to indicate programming errors, such as accessing a null object
    reference or dividing by zero.
What is the difference between a stack and a queue data structure in Java?
    Answer: The main difference between stack and queue is in the order in which elements are added and removed. stack
    data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out meaning element which added last to the stack will remove first. queue
    data structure follows first-In-First-Out meaning element which added to queue first will remove first. Stack is
    used for tasked which required backtracking maintaining a history. Queues are used in scenarios where tasks are
    processed in the order they arrive, such as job scheduling, task management, and breadth-first search algorithms.
What is the purpose of the synchronized keyword in Java?
    Answer: The purpose of using synchronized keyword is to control accessed to the critical section of a code,
    ensuring that only one thread can execute a synchronized block or method at a time. Primary purpose of this keyword
    is to ensure thread safety in multi threading environment.
What is the purpose of the volatile keyword in Java?
    Answer: Purpose of using this keyword is it indicates that a variable may be modified by multiple threads
    simultaneously. By using this keyword in variable declaration it guarantees that the changes made to a volatile
    variable by a one thread  are visible to other threads. It reduces the risk of data irregularity in multi threading
    environment.
What is the purpose of the transient keyword in Java?
    Answer: The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized when an object
    is converted to a byte stream. Its primary purpose is to exclude specific fields from the object's persistent
    state during serialization. This is often used for fields that are not serializable or contain sensitive or
    temporary data that doesn't need to be preserved between object states.
What is the difference between the equals() and hashCode() methods in Java?
    Answer: To compare the value or content of two object, programmer uses equals() method in java. Usually this method
    gets overridden to used proper comparison. equals() method returns boolean value.
    Data retrieval in hash-based collection like hashmap and hashset is done by hashCode() method. It returns an integer
    value representing the hashcode of an object.
What is the purpose of the finalize() method in Java?
    Answer: The finalize() method is a method provided by the Object class in Java. Its purpose is to allow an object
    to perform cleanup operations before it is garbage collected by the JVM. When the JVM decides to reclaim memory
    occupied by an object, it calls the finalize() method of that object (if it's overridden) to allow it to release r
    resources or perform other cleanup tasks.
What is the purpose of the this keyword in Java?
    Answer:this keyword is used to call or accessed the current class members (variable or method)
           this keyword is required when we have a parameter with same name as an instance variable or field
           NOTE: we can use either of them anywhere in a class, except for a static element, like a static method, any
           attempt to do so can create a compile time error
           This is commonly used in constructor when the instance variable name and parameter passed in the contractor
           has the same name.
           this() method is used to call a contractor from another overloaded contractor in the same class
           Call of this() is only be used in a contractor, and it has to be the first executable statement in the
           constructor
           this() method is used in a constructor method chaining
What is the difference between a superclass and a subclass in Java?
    Answer: Superclass is a parent class and subclass is a child class. Super class hav all the common attributes and
    behaviour that all the subclass can share. when a subclass extends to superclass it inherits all the behaviour,
    attributes and actions(methods) of a parent class. A superclass cannot inherits from a subclass. A superclass can
    have multiple subclasses but subclass cannot have multiple parents.
What is the purpose of the package keyword in Java?
    Answer: package keyword in java is used for organizing code in related group, control access meaning Packages
    provide a level of access control and visibility. Classes within the same package can access each other's
    package-private (default) members (fields, methods, and constructors) without needing to make them public. Classes
    outside the package can only access the public members. It also ensure reusability and modularity of existing code.
What is the difference between an instance variable and a class variable in Java?
    Answer: An Instance variable is an instance of class. A class variable is also known as a static variable which
    belong to the class. Static variable holds the same value for every action, however an instance variable holds an
    unique value for every instance of that class. Any changes to the static variable will have an effect on every action
    of that class, but changes to the instance variable do not change the outcome of the instances of that class.
What is the purpose of the instanceof operator in Java?
    Answer: he primary purposes of the instanceof operator are as follows:
            Type Checking:
            You can use instanceof to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or interface. This is
            helpful when dealing with polymorphism, where objects of different types can be stored in a common
            container (e.g., an array or a collection), and you need to perform type-specific operations.
            Type Casting:
            When you're dealing with object references of a more general type (e.g., a superclass or interface), you
            can use instanceof to check the type of the object before casting it to a more specific type. This helps
            avoid runtime exceptions like ClassCastException.
What is the purpose of the super keyword in Java?
    Answer: super keyword is used to call the parent class member(variable, methods). super keyword is used when we
    override the parent class's method.
    Note:super() is used in a constructor to call the parent class constructor
         The call to the super() in constructor has to be the first executable statement in your method block
What is the purpose of the abstract keyword in Java?
    Answer: Abstract keyword is used to create abstract class and and methods. In abstract class you cannot create any
    instance or object of this class. abstract classes works as a blueprint for other class which inherits from it.
    Abstract methods are methods declared without an implementation (no method body).
    Abstract methods are defined within abstract classes and are meant to be implemented by concrete subclasses that
    extend the abstract class.
    Subclasses must provide an implementation for all abstract methods, or they, too, must be declared as abstract.
    Abstract classes and methods provide a way to create a hierarchy of related classes with a shared structure,
    while still allowing flexibility for concrete subclasses to implement their specific functionality. Subclasses that
    inherit from an abstract class must provide implementations for abstract methods, making them useful for defining
    a common set of methods that should exist across a group of related classes.
What is the purpose of the interface keyword in Java?
    Answer: interface keyword is used to create an interface in java. An interface in java work as a contract. It cannot
    have any instance variable, it can only have abstract method which will be implemented by the subclasses which implement
    them. Multiple inheritance is possible with interface.
What is the difference between a private and a protected access modifier in Java?
    Answer: private and protected both keywords in java is to the control access of the class's fields and actions. When
    we want our fields and methods to give access only in its classes we use private keyword. When we want to limit the
    accessibility and visibility of the class's members(attributes, behaviour and actions) inside its own package, subclasses
    and ints own classes, we use protected keyword.
What is the purpose of the throws keyword in Java?
    Answer: The throws keyword in Java is used to declare exceptions that a method might throw. It serves as both
    documentation for developers and a mechanism for specifying and propagating exceptions. By including the throws
    clause in a method's signature, developers communicate which exceptions can potentially be raised by the method.
    This helps other code that uses the method to anticipate and handle these exceptions. When an exception declared
    with throws occurs in the method, it can be propagated up the call stack, allowing higher-level code to handle
    the exception, promoting clean and modular exception handling in Java applications.
