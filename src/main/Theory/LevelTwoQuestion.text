What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?
    Answer: Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods. An interface can only have abstract method,
    but after java 8, an interface can have default and static method with implementation. Abstract class can have
    instance variable but interface can't have. multiple inheritance is not allowed in abstract class but you can
    implement multiple interfaces. Abstract class is used when you want to provide a common base for multiple classes
    that share some common behavior. Interface work as a contract that multiple class can be adhere to, irrespective
    to their class hierarchy.
What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java?
    Answer: static keyword is used to create members(classes, methods and fields) which belong to the class itself.
    It is used in creating shared data, utilities, constant and so on.
What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java?
    Answer: final keyword is used when a member(methods, fields) can't be changed. It is used to enforced immutability
    it is prevent method overriding, define constant. It is used for code maintainability, reliability, quality by
    making some methods and fields unchangeable and undependable.
What is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception in Java?
    Answer: Checked exception are checked in compile-time but unchecked exception are not checked in compile-time.
    checked exception are subclasses of Exception class, unchecked exception are subclass of RuntimeException.
    Any method that might throw a checked exception must declare it using the throws keyword in its method signature.
    For unchecked exception, you don't need to throw any throws declaration in method signature. Example of checked
    exceptions are IOException, ClassNotFoundException, and SQLException. example of unchecked exception are
    NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException.Checked exceptions are used for
    situations that a well-behaved program should anticipate and handle, such as file I/O errors or database connection
    issues. Unchecked exceptions are typically used to indicate programming errors, such as accessing a null object
    reference or dividing by zero.
What is the difference between a stack and a queue data structure in Java?
    Answer: The main difference between stack and queue is in the order in which elements are added and removed. stack
    data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out meaning element which added last to the stack will remove first. queue
    data structure follows first-In-First-Out meaning element which added to queue first will remove first. Stack is
    used for tasked which required backtracking maintaining a history. Queues are used in scenarios where tasks are
    processed in the order they arrive, such as job scheduling, task management, and breadth-first search algorithms.
What is the purpose of the synchronized keyword in Java?
    Answer: The purpose of using synchronized keyword is to control accessed to the critical section of a code,
    ensuring that only one thread can execute a synchronized block or method at a time. Primary purpose of this keyword
    is to ensure thread safety in multi threading environment.
What is the purpose of the volatile keyword in Java?
    Answer: Purpose of using this keyword is it indicates that a variable may be modified by multiple threads
    simultaneously. By using this keyword in variable declaration it guarantees that the changes made to a volatile
    variable by a one thread  are visible to other threads. It reduces the risk of data irregularity in multi threading
    environment.
What is the purpose of the transient keyword in Java?
    Answer: The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized when an object
    is converted to a byte stream. Its primary purpose is to exclude specific fields from the object's persistent
    state during serialization. This is often used for fields that are not serializable or contain sensitive or
    temporary data that doesn't need to be preserved between object states.
What is the difference between the equals() and hashCode() methods in Java?
    Answer: To compare the value or content of two object, programmer uses equals() method in java. Usually this method
    gets overridden to used proper comparison. equals() method returns boolean value.
    Data retrieval in hash-based collection like hashmap and hashset is done by hashCode() method. It returns an integer
    value representing the hashcode of an object.
What is the purpose of the finalize() method in Java?
    Answer: The finalize() method is a method provided by the Object class in Java. Its purpose is to allow an object
    to perform cleanup operations before it is garbage collected by the JVM. When the JVM decides to reclaim memory
    occupied by an object, it calls the finalize() method of that object (if it's overridden) to allow it to release r
    esources or perform other cleanup tasks.

What is the purpose of the abstract keyword in Java?
What is the purpose of the interface keyword in Java?
