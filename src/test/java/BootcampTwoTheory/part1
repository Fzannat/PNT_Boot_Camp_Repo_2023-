What are Locators, different types of locators and their priorities in
Selenium?
Answer: There are 8 locator. id, name, class name, cssSelector, xpath, linkText, partial linkText, tagName
Priority:
    1.ID: High priority, as IDs should be unique within a page.
    2.Name: Generally high priority if names are unique.
    3.Class Name: Lower priority than ID and Name, as multiple elements can share the same class.
    4.XPath and CSS Selector: Flexible and powerful but may have lower priority due to potential complexity and performance concerns.
    5.Tag Name, Link Text, Partial Link Text: Typically lower priority, especially in complex or dynamic web pages.
What are the different types of drivers in Selenium WebDriver?
Answer: In Selenium WebDriver, the term "driver" refers to the browser-specific driver that communicates with the respective
web browser and facilitates the interaction between Selenium scripts and the browser. Each browser has its own
WebDriver implementation. The main types of drivers in Selenium WebDriver are: ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, EdgeDriver,
SafariDriver, InternetExplorerDriver.

What are the different types of navigation commands in WebDriver?
In Selenium WebDriver, navigation commands are used to navigate between different pages or interact with the browser's
history. The WebDriver interface provides several methods for navigation. The main navigation commands are:

driver.get("https://www.example.com");

// Navigate to another page
driver.navigate().to("https://www.example2.com");

What are the different types of waits available in WebDriver?
WebDriver provides different types of waits to handle synchronization issues and ensure that scripts execute reliably.
Implicit Wait sets a global timeout for the entire session, allowing WebDriver to wait for an element to be present
before throwing an exception. Explicit Wait, on the other hand, offers more control by applying conditions to specific
elements, such as visibility or presence, improving script stability and performance. The Fluent Wait is a flexible
mechanism that defines maximum wait time and polling intervals, allowing customized conditions and exception handling
during polling. These waits are essential for dealing with dynamic content and varying page load times, contributing to
the effectiveness and reliability of automated test scripts. Adjusting wait times based on the application's behavior
and potential delays ensures a smoother testing process.

What is the latest Selenium tool?

framework. Selenium 4 brought several new features, improvements, and better compatibility with modern web technologies.
It included enhanced support for W3C WebDriver standards, improved relative locators, and updates to the Selenium Grid.
